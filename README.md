Main functions that return circuits in `qrm_circuits_new.py` (as presented in our paper) and `qrm_circuits.py` (in an old form, distinct from the paper). Circuits are constructed using [tequila](https://github.com/tequilahub/tequila) and [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit) is used to visualize the circuits.  

Pass the code parameters $(r, m)$ as needed, add partition and qubit list optionally.
